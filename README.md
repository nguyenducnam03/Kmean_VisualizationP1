# Kmean_VisualizationP1
This is coding python Kmean visualizatoin Python

This is have two part of Kmean:
 First is coding Kmean without library on sklearn, with foundation of this algorithm, training point --> rand point --> test -> result.
I think that's code almost is visualization of kmean for understanding that more than predict, predict perhap in the code of using library.
Of course you can easily predict that, In my code don't have that because I'm only visualization.
 Second is coding by using sklearn library, only pass the argument on it.

That coding I've learn from Dung Lai Lap Trinh (Teacher Vietnamese's studying at Australia 1 month ago), and now I want to code again for better understand (Search myself and don't use anything of old code).

I hope you'll like that.
